# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project contains basics of web development. It was made to keep track of things learned in the Prework lesson.
It helps keep a concise overview of how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git instead of having to review the whole Prework lesson.
I learned that making a basic webpage with simple styling isn't that hard and seems fun!

## Usage

You can use this to review the content learned in the Prework about web development basics.
There are 4 sections, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and under each section the user can read a brief overview of that part of web development.
In the DevTools consoles, there is some JavaScript running that lists the topics, and randomly tells the user what we should study.
